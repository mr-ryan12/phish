## Abstract

Welcome to Phish! This is a music listening application where Phish Phans can enjoy listening to songs from all of their live shows dating back to 1983! Users can view a list of all shows categorized by the year played, click on a show and view all of the songs played at the show. They also have the option to add their favorite songs to a playlist!  
  
Too many shows to filter through and pick one? Not to worry! Simply click on the "Random Show" link and a show will be randomly generated with all of the tracks available for listening!  
  
Feel free to check out the application [here](https://phish-showcase.vercel.app/)  
  
## Learning Goals
- Successfully build and deploy a fully functional React application in a short amount of time  
- Gain technical exposure to working with React Router and Cypress
- Learn how to handle asynchronous operations after a component has unmounted
- Effectively stub network requests that require fetching test data

## Challenges and Wins  
This was by far the largest dataset I have worked with. It was interesting to learn about handling asynchronous tasks and manipulating large datasets to display and interact with the information. I would like to implement a search feature and a way to store the playlist data in a future iteration.
